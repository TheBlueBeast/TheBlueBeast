TheBlueBeast Core
=============

Intro
-----
TheBlueBeast is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending, creating an artificial neural network. This is accomplished by each node acting as a synapse using the hexadceimal code as thought being transported, we expect it to become sentient around block 500000 with 3000 nodes. Utilizing a "Scrypt" POW system with a brand new "Beast" algorythm that captures the incoming processed blocks as the synapse/information relay system


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run thebluebeast-qt.exe.

TheBlueBeast Core is the original TheBlueBeast client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of TheBlueBeast transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
